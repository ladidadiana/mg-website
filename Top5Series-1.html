    <p>As we are approaching exam season one of the most valuable resources available to medical students when you need a simple, easy-to-understand explanation of a topic is YOUTUBE! When you have to choose between reading a chapter of a book or watching a video – we all know which is going to win!</p>
    <p>If you know where to look and search for the right channels, a video explanation can be the best thing you could ask for. So here are 5 of our favourite channels for pre-clinical medicine that you definitely need to get down to survive medical school…</p>


    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheAnatomyZone"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/ukmlaforums.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1.png?w=494&ssl=1" alt="Anatomy Zone YouTube Logo" class="youtube-logo"> </a>

    <p>When you’re reading about the anatomical arrangement of vessels in a textbook, nothing seems to quite make sense. These videos talk through a topic it small chunks and allow you to visualise the structures so the jargon in the textbook makes much better sense. It is a great way to orientate yourself if you are going to start a new topic in anatomy.</p>
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <h5>Subscriber count: 257,833</h5>
    <p>This has got to be the number one channel for physiology! Their slogan “ Difficult concepts, Simple explanations “ couldn’t be more correct.</p>
    <p>They have a vast number of videos, of different processes and mechanisms all explained clearly in a logical manner. The detail is definitely there, but it’s delivered in small understandable chunks, making it an ideal source to use, especially to support topics that have been covered in lectures that you might have had. And as a plus, the lecturer uses some pretty colourful handwritten notes to supplement the explanations.</p>

    <h5>Subscriber count: 495,326</h5>
    <p>Osmosis has got to be a favourite amongst all medical students – both pre-clinical and clinical. This channel is great for specific diseases and explanations regarding their pathophysiology. The kinetics of the video is great, with lots of diagrams and flowcharts. Adapting the famous words of a picture is worth a thousand words, a diagram must therefore be worth a million. The visual aspect of these explanations definitely sticks in your head and is just the best resource to get an overview on any medical condition you might need!</p>

    <br><br>
    <h5>Subscriber count: 697,137</h5>
    <p>Another great channel encompassing both physiology and pathophysiology. The videos provide in-depth overviews of particular topics and the organisation of information into diagrams and charts are so helpful in getting them to stick in your brain. Clear, concise and well-presented topics that are definitely worth a watch to clarify virtually any medical topic that hasn’t seemed to click right away.</p>

    <h5>Subscriber count: 179,527</h5>
    <p>The videos are more like a traditional lecture with very in-depth and clear explanations. The channel answers specific questions and tends to have a more clinical focus to it. The videos are particularly useful when working on PBLS to meet all the objectives on your learning agenda or when you have had enough reading through your notes and you just want to be talked through the core concepts in detail!</p>
